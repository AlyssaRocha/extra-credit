# instructions:
# I have created a file with some functions and have already imported scanner for you
# DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING I GAVE IN THE ORIGINAL FILE
# set 3 varibles each = a random number beween 1 - 10
# print a statment saying something along the lines of "The product of the 3 numbers is:" + PRODUCT 
# print another statment but for the sum instead
# ask the user to guess the 3 numbers and store the inputs in varibles
# use scanner to store all 3 inputs in variables
# use fill in the ExtraCredit.check(a, b, c, d, f, g) 
# a b and c should be the random varibles
# d f and g should be the users inputs
# it will return a statment saying if you were correct or not
# if you are bad at guessing then you can have "debugging lines" - print statments that bring each random number
# once done it will return your results
